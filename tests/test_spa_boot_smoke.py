"""Boot smoke test — the guard that makes "tests green" mean "the site works".

Why this exists: the rest of the suite is unit-level (it greps strings out of
index.html / *.js / *.css) and the ~320 Playwright e2e tests are gated out of the
fast lane. So a change could leave the SPA a fully blank page — failing to boot,
or shipping an unstyled / unlinked stylesheet — while every test the developer
runs still passes. This file closes that gap with ONE cheap, deterministic check:
load the app the way it actually runs and assert it BOOTS, RENDERS, and is STYLED,
with nothing thrown.

It is tagged BOTH `e2e` (so the chromium-free `-m "not e2e"` lane still skips it)
AND `smoke` (so `pytest -m smoke` runs just this, ~5s, as the boot gate for any
SPA change). Deterministic + offline: GitHub is mocked to an empty repo tree, so
the index renders its empty state without network.
