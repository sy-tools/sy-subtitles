"""Guards for the single required check on `main`.

A required status check has to be a check that is ALWAYS reported, whatever
the pull request touched. The lanes in ci.yml are not: they were gated by a
workflow-level `paths` filter, so a pull request outside those paths produced
no run at all — requiring any of them by name would leave such a PR waiting
forever on a check that is never going to arrive.

Worse, without a required check nothing notices when a run simply fails to
appear. That is how #1069 merged: its CI run was never dispatched (a
transient Actions failure — two probes later confirmed the path filter itself
was fine), no lane reported, and the PR was mergeable anyway.

So ci.yml now runs on every pull request and decides INSIDE the workflow which
lanes are needed, and `gate` — which depends on all of them and always runs —
is the one check to require.
