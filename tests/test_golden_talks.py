"""Golden-file regression tests on real talks.

These tests treat the merged-to-main `final/uk.srt` files as the oracle and
enforce two cross-tool invariants that the pipeline should never break:

1. `validate_subtitles` passes on every shipped uk.srt against its
   `transcript_uk.txt` (text preservation, numbering, durations, gaps, CPS, CPL).
2. Running `optimize_srt` on a shipped uk.srt produces an output that still
   passes `validate_subtitles` and is block-stable (idempotency contract —
   the second run changes nothing material beyond report lines).

Any new change to build_map, build_srt, optimize_srt, sync_* or the validator
config will trip these the moment it regresses shipped data. This is the
"real talk" regression surface the audit asked for.
