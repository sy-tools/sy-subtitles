"""Sync subtitle text edits back into transcript_uk.txt.

Mirror of sync_transcript_to_srt: takes the diff between an old and a
new SRT, then applies the changes to the transcript file in-place.

Supported edits:
  - text-only edits (block count unchanged)
  - block deletions (e.g. removing a placeholder block) — the deleted
    text is removed from the transcript if found, otherwise skipped
    silently (placeholders are often not in the transcript)

Unsupported (returns error):
  - block insertions — there's no signal where to insert text in the
    transcript; needs full pipeline rebuild
  - block-group replacements with different counts — too ambiguous
    for automated propagation; needs full pipeline rebuild

After processing the new SRT is rewritten via write_srt, which
normalizes block numbering — handy when the user deleted blocks but
forgot to renumber.

Usage:
    python -m tools.sync_srt_to_transcript \
        --old-srt OLD --new-srt NEW --transcript transcript_uk.txt
