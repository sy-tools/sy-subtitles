"""Two-pass sync driver for the sync-subtitles PR workflow.

Given a base git SHA and a list of changed transcript/SRT paths, this
script runs the reverse-then-forward sync that the workflow used to do
in bash:

  Step A (SRT → transcript): for each changed uk.srt, diff it against
  the base-SHA version and apply the text changes to transcript_uk.txt
  in-place. Accumulates across all changed SRTs in a talk.

  Step B (transcript → SRT): for each video in each affected talk,
  diff the (possibly Step-A-updated) transcript against a per-video
  effective-old baseline and apply the result to that video's uk.srt.

The per-video effective-old baseline is the key fix for mixed PRs
(transcript edited AND a uk.srt edited in the same commit). Without
it, Step B would try to match the BASE transcript's text in the
already-edited SRT — find_paragraph_blocks fails because the old text
is no longer there. With it, each video gets a baseline that matches
its current SRT state: base_transcript + that video's own Step A
edits, which is exactly what the SRT now represents. The diff that
Step B then applies contains only the work Step A couldn't already
do for that video (direct transcript edits and other videos' SRT
edits, which still need to propagate here).

Invocation:
    python -m tools.sync_pr --base-sha $BASE_SHA

The tool reads `git diff --name-only $BASE_SHA HEAD` itself so the
workflow doesn't need to pre-filter. Exits 0 on success, 1 on any
sync/validate failure (with a GitHub Actions ::error:: line per
failure). Intentionally mutates the working tree (the workflow then
commits whatever changed).
