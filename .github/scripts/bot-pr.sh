# Create a PR with bot changes instead of pushing directly to main.
#
# Usage:
#   .github/scripts/bot-pr.sh <branch_prefix> <commit_message> <add_paths...>
#
# Example:
#   .github/scripts/bot-pr.sh bot/whisper "Add Whisper data" talks/*/*/source/whisper.json
#
# The PR targets the ref the run was dispatched from (GITHUB_REF_NAME),
# falling back to main. Override with BOT_PR_BASE.
#
# Requirements:
#   - GH_TOKEN must be set (for gh CLI)
#   - Must be run from repo root with git configured
